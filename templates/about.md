My name is [Evan][me], and you are currently reading my personal
website. Hopefully you have found this place in good fortune. I use
this site to document technical projects and write about other things
I find interesting.

## About this website

This website is a static site hosted on [S3][s3], and all of the
source code is on [GitHub][github]. The CSS style framework
is [Skeleton][skele] and code syntax highlighting is done on the
client-side using [highlight.js][highlight].

## Get in touch
