My name is Evan, and you are currently reading my personal
website. Hopefully you have found this place in good fortune. I use
this site to document technical projects I am working on and to write
about other things that interest me such as:

- Web development
- Statistics
- Cycling, running, hiking
- Music

## About this website

This website is a static site generated by a Python script I wrote,
you can check out the source on [GitHub][github]. The css style
framework is [Skeleton][skele] a small and responsive framework with
tasteful defaults. Code syntax highlighting is done via javascript
using [highlight.js][highlight].

## Get in touch
