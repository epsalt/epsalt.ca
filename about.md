Hey, welcome to my website.

My name is Evan, and I live in Calgary. I am interested in statistics,
data visualization, and programming. In my free time I like to run,
ride bikes, and read about technology.

This style for this site uses skeleton, a lightweight CSS
grid framework. The website is a static site hosted on
Amazon S3. Posts are generated from markdown using a
python script.
