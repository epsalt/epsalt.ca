![Loud music warning][loud]

Canadian ambient music producer [Tim Hecker][tim-hecker] played live
in Calgary last month. I only found out a few days in advance, but was
fortunate enough to secure a ticket last minute. Although Hecker's
music is [sparse and experimental][virgins], his live shows have the
reputation of being immersive and loud as hell. Not something that I
wanted to miss.

Philip Sherburne gave a nice overview of Hecker's music in his review
of 2016's [Love Streams][streams]:

> His work is sculptural in feel and widescreen in scope, and it is
> extraordinarily attentive to texture. Foremost among his concerns
> has been the idea of diffuseness, of dissolution. There are few hard
> edges, few identifiable motifs; musical events, like a shift in tone
> or the introduction of a new timbre, often take place under the
> cover of static. He prefers distant shapes with vague outlines.

A few hours before show time, I received a message from the venue with
a some words of caution. The performance would be loud enough to
warrant hearing protection, and take place in *total darkness*. The
second part caught me off guard.

Many of the electronic acts I have seen live have incorporated a
visual component. Playing electronic music live lacks the sheer
kinetic energy of a rock show. Projected video or generative graphics
can serve as a replacement for this missing motion component.

Playing in darkness could be interpreted as a challenge to the
necessity of this graphical accompaniment. A more likely explanation
is that there was a logistical issue with Hecker's lighting rig and
the venue, so he simply decided to perform without. Either way,
playing in darkness seems decidedly on-brand for a Tim Hecker show.

When the lights went down, the venue was not completely dark. Two exit
signs on either side of the stage radiated red light. When anyone left
the room, light entered through the doorway and cast long shadows.

Hecker played for a over an hour with no pauses between songs for
applause. Extended periods of continual drone music in near darkness
do interesting things to the brain. My mind wandered and I
drifted&mdash;decoupled from reality. I have never been in a [sensory
deprivation tank][tank], but I reckon it is a similar feeling.

In the [liner notes][eno] of *Music for Airports / Ambient 1*, Brian
Eno theorized that there is a versatility inherent to ambient music.

> Ambient Music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening
> attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as
> ignorable as it is interesting.

The usual level at which I interact with ambient music does not
involve total darkness and excessive volume. Most of the time, I
listen when I am working. Lyric-free electronic music helps me
concentrate. As I've gotten older, multitasking has become more
difficult. Trying to juggle context between work and anything more
dense, like a podcast, is impossible.

The website [musicForProgramming][mfp] offers an explanation of how
certain types of music can aid focus.

> Music possessing [certain] qualities can often provide just the
> right amount of interest to occupy the parts of your brain that
> would otherwise be left free to wander and lead to distraction
> during your work.

The implicit minimalism of ambient music allows it to act as a kind of
mental scaffolding. The level of engagement dictates the structure
formed. Although other genres of music can be appreciated on many
levels, ambient music is unique in its formlessness. From a blanker
slate, the scope of possibilities is larger.

## Further listening

It took a while for the ambient side to click for me. If you have
hesitated in the past, give one of these records a chance. They are
all fine listening for working on a project, reading in the bath, or
as the soundtrack for a long nap.
