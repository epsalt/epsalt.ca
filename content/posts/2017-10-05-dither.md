Last November I attended the [GIRAF][1] independent animation festival
in Calgary. I have been a few years in a row now, and it is always
well curated and a lot of fun. [Inside][2], a short by Paris-based
artist [Mattis Dovier][3] was one of my favorite films of the festival
last year. Check it out below:

I appreciated the lo-fi, 90's video game aesthetic that the artist
created in the short film. It reminded me of the MS-DOS video games I
grew up on, like [Commander Keen][4] and [Math Blaster][5]. Nostalgia
is a powerful thing.

## Dither

Dovier uses a graphics technique called "dither" extensively in his
animation. The short is entirely black and white, so dither is used to
create shading and depth. [Wikipedia][6] describes dither as:

> An intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize
> quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color
> banding in images.

Dither is a versatile concept with many cross-domain applications, it
especially useful when processing audio, image, and video data. Some
other uses for dither that I found interesting include:

- The [mastering][7] of audio in order to override harmonic tones
  produced by some digital filters
- Reduction of color banding and other visual artifacts
  during [image processing][8]
- [Seismic data processing][9]
- The addition of random delay (referred to
  as [temporal buffering][10]) to financial order flow in order to
  reduce the effectiveness of high frequency trading

## Dither in image processing

A common use of dither in image processing is to reduce visual
artifacts and preserve information when moving to a more restricted
color space. Today's screens and graphics cards support the display of
more than 24 bits color (16+ million different colors). Older screens,
however, did not have this capability, although even today some media
formats are more restrictive than you may realize
([GIF files only support 256 unique colors][11]).

We can demonstrate visual artifacts associated with a reduction in
color space by converting an image to monochrome (black and
white). The Python function below changes each pixel in the source
image to whichever color it is closest to, black or white.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from PIL import Image

def monochrome(source):
    """Convert an image from color to black and white. 
    Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18778280"""
    img = Image.open(source)
    greyscale = img.convert('L')
    monochrome = greyscale.point(lambda x:0 if x < 128 else 255, '1')
    return monochrome

```

![Gracey in b/w](/images/gracey_bw.jpg)
*Gracey converted to black and white using the `monochrome` python function*

As you can see the the image above, if you convert an image to a more
restrictive color space a great deal of image detail can potentially
be lost. This is an extreme example, 1-bit monochrome color is the
most restrictive color space possible!

Applying a dithering step to this process is a way of preserving
detail by tricking the brain while still moving to a more restrictive
palette of colors.

## Floydâ€“Steinberg dithering

There are over ten different implementations of the dithering
algorithm, all which look slightly different and produce
distinct [visual patterns][12]. The display medium for the image
(animation, printed, screen) and the size of the output are
considerations for picking the algorithm.

Below is a Python implementation of [Floyd-Steinberg dithering][13].
The Floyd-Steinberg algorithm makes use of the concept
of [error-diffusion][14]. The residual error from the conversion of a
pixel is passed to it's neighbours. If the algorithm has rounded a lot
of pixels in one direction, it becomes more likely that the next pixel
will be rounded in the other direction. This error diffusion is
responsible for the [pointilism][15] effect which preserves image
detail and fools our brain.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def fl_dither(image, palette):
    """Convert the colors in image to those in the supplied palette using
    the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm."""
    img = Image.open(image)
    for y in range(img.height):
        for x in range(img.width):
            oldpixel = img.getpixel((x, y))
            newpixel = closest_color(oldpixel, palette)
            img.putpixel((x, y), newpixel)
            error = np.subtract(oldpixel, newpixel)

            if x < img.width - 1:
                diffuse(img, x+1, y, error, 0.4375)

            if x > 0 and y < img.height - 1:
                diffuse(img, x-1, y+1, error, 0.1875)

            if y < img.height - 1:
                diffuse(img, x, y+1, error, 0.3125)

            if x < img.width - 1 and y < img.height - 1:
                diffuse(img, x+1, y+1, error, 0.0625)
    return img

def diffuse(img, x, y, error, coeff):
    """Diffuse the conversion error at (x,y) to neighbouring
    pixels."""
    newpixel = np.add(img.getpixel((x, y)), np.multiply(error, coeff))
    img.putpixel((x, y), tuple(np.int_(newpixel)))

def closest_color(pixel, palette):
    """Return the closest color in palette to the provided pixel."""
    array = np.asarray(palette)-pixel
    index = np.argmin(np.linalg.norm(array, axis=1))
    return palette[index]
```

<img alt="Gracey" src="/images/fl_gracey.jpg" style="image-rendering: pixelated;">
*Photo of Gracey converted to black and white using Floyd-Steinberg
dithering*

The black and white photo of Gracey created using Floyd-Steinberg
dithering has a significant amount more visual information retained
than the image created using the `monochrome` Python function from
earlier. Shading is visible in the dithered photo, represented by a
differing density of black or white pixels. The new image also
possesses that 90's video game feel I mentioned at the beginning
of this post.
