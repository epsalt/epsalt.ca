Old geologic maps have become somewhat of a fascination of mine. I
stumbled upon some at work and have been collecting my favorite
examples ever since. The color palettes and symbology speak to me,
plus they stand up well as examples of good data visualization.

I decided on my favorite era of the medium after an afternoon of
querying the [USGS National Geologic Map Database][mgmdb]. My research
points to 1960-1975 as the aesthetic golden age of geologic map
publication in America. Below I have included one of my favorites, a
map of Palo Alto by [Thomas Dibblee][tdb] from 1966. Click on the map
to view full size on the [USGS][USGS] site.

quadrangle, California**: California Division of Mines and Geology,
Map Sheet 8, scale 1:62,500 Map Sheet 8: Geologic map.*

What I like most about this graphic is the diverse cast of symbology
supporting the primary map. Each figure, table, legend, and glyph
works together to describe a complex natural system. In *[Beautiful
Evidence][be-book]*, [Edward Tufte][tufte] explains the value of
including different modes of information in data visualizations.

Geological maps like the one above are a great example of this
principle. When maps are combined with supporting figures, tables, and
text, the publications become more than a sum of their parts. They are
transformed into a guidebook for a section of the earth over hundreds
of thousands of years.

Below I have included a some more vintage earth science graphics from
the [USGS][USGS]. Make sure to click through to the the high
resolution versions.
