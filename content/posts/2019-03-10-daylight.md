summary: Using D3.js and leaflet to visualize daylight hours across the globe
---

Today is one of my least favorite days of the year. In most
jurisdictions across Canada, March 10th is the start of Daylight
Savings Time (DST). That means that one hour of sleep was taken from
me in exchange for an extra hour of daylight in the evening. I did not
agree to this trade.

I have been thinking recently about the effect that changing daylight
hours through the year has on people living at extreme latitudes. Just
ask anyone from Anchorage or Oslo &mdash; long winter nights and
endless summer days contribute immensely to the identity of a place.

These thoughts ended up as manifesting as a project I have been
working on during dark evenings this winter, a Javascript
visualization of the phases of sunlight for locations across the
globe.

## Trolling

The Troll Antarctic research station produces one of the most dramatic
daylight charts. [According to Wikipedia][troll], the Troll station
was established in 1990 and is built on a slope of solid rock instead
of snow pack, which is unique among most research stations on the
continent (sounds nice).

Troll caused me quite a bit of trouble and debugging time because of
its abnormal two hour Daylight Saving Time change. According to a
[footnote to the *Time in Antarctica Wikipedia page*][troll-dst] there
is an (somewhat) rational reason for this:

> The time zone where Troll is located, UTC+0, is 1 hours behind
> Norwegian time". Contacts with the Norwegian Polar Institute has
> revealed that they use UTC+2 (Norwegian DST) during the dark winter,
> for communication simplicity, since no airplanes fly anyway then.

## Wrap-up & Acknowledgments

This project was directly inspired by two sources, the excellent
daylight charts from [timeanddate.com][td.com] and an interactive map
of the world from the landing page of [Moment Timezone][mtz]. I think
that linking the two adds something useful, but this project is at its
core a reimplentation and combination of those two sources.

If you have any ideas for improvements or want to see how it works,
all the source code is on [Github][repo].
