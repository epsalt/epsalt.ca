Hey, welcome! 

My name is **Evan Saltman** and this is my personal website. I am an
engineer and developer from Calgary, Canada. Right now I am working at
[MyHEAT][myheat] doing web and geospatial development.

I am really interested in data visualization and mapping using modern
web technologies. If you are doing something cool in that space we
should talk! Send me a note at the email address in the sidebar. I am
also reachable as <code>@epsalt</code> on Twitter and Github.

This website was generated from markdown using [litesite][static], a
static generator I wrote in Python. All of the source code for
building this website is on [GitHub][homepage]. Except where otherwise
noted, all original content on this site is licensed [CC-BY][cc].
