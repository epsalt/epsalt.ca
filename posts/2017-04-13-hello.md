This is the first post on my new website. I'm planning on using this
site to document and show off any technology projects I have worked
on. I'm great at starting projects---but not so great at completing
them---the goal of the blogging process is to add a final shippable
step to encourage going the distance.

I'll also try to write about some of my other interests and things
going on in my life. I'm training to run a marathon at the end of may,
so I will likely write about that. Other topics might include: bikes,
hiking, music, and books.

Thanks for reading!
