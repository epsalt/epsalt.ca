This is the first post on my new website. I'm planning on using this
site to document and show off any technology projects I have worked
on. I'm great at starting projects---but not so great at completing
them--- the goal of the blogging process is to add a final shippable
step to encourage going the distance.

I'll also try to write about some of my other interests and things
going on in my life. I'm training to run a marathon at the end of may,
so I will likely write about that. Other topics might include: bikes,
hiking, music, and books.

For those interested in the technical details, this website is
generated using a static site generator I wrote in python. The style
framework is skeleton which is light weight and just simple enough for
my purposes. Code syntax highlighting is done by highlight.js.
