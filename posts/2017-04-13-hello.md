This is the first post on my new website. I'm planning on using this
site to document technology projects I am working on. I'm great at
starting projects---but not so great at completing them. The goal of
this process is to add a final step to encourage myself to go the
distance.

I'll also try to write about some of the other things going on in my
life. I'm running a marathon later this spring and restoring an
eighties Norco road bike. Both of which should be interesting to write
about.

Thanks for reading.
